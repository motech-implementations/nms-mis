                        <p>This report gives the line-listing of all Child beneficiaries whose registered mobile numbers are either incorrect or are duplicate.
                            These mobile numbers had flown in to the IVRS system but were rejected by the acceptance logic run by the IVRS system.
                            The report contains the MCTS or RCH IDs. This report would be generated once every week preferably on Sunday.
                            This line listing report would be available for download for the respective district and block users.
                            These reports would be e-mailed to the respective block and district users on the day after it was generated –on Tuesday.
                            A summary mail giving the district wise break-up of the count of beneficiaries would be sent to the State / UT users on the same day.
                            The State / UT can act upon this report and contact the ASHAs in the field and ask them to contact the said beneficiaries
                            and register their correct mobile numbers in the RCH Application. In this way we can correct the mobile numbers of
                            beneficiaries and bring a higher percentage of beneficiaries under the ambit of Kilkari program. This report is
                            a very useful actionable report for the State / UT to correct the beneficiary contact mobile number.</p>

                        <p>This report gives the line-listing of all Mother beneficiaries whose registered mobile numbers are either incorrect or are duplicate.
                            These mobile numbers had flown in to the IVRS system but were rejected by the acceptance logic run by the IVRS system.
                            The report contains the MCTS or RCH IDs. This report would be generated once every week preferably on Sunday.
                            This line listing report would be available for download for the respective district and block users.
                            These reports would be e-mailed to the respective block and district users on the day after it was generated –on Tuesday.
                            A summary mail giving the district wise break-up of the count of beneficiaries would be sent to the State / UT users on the same day. The State / UT can act upon this report and contact the ASHAs in the field and ask them to contact the said beneficiaries and register their correct mobile numbers in the RCH Application. In this way we can correct the mobile numbers of beneficiaries and bring a higher percentage of beneficiaries under the ambit of Kilkari program. This report is a very useful actionable report for the State / UT to correct the beneficiary contact mobile number.</p>
