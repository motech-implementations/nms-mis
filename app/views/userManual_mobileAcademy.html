                            were not registered in the system. It is presumed that these anonymous numbers are the
                            numbers that are used by ASHAs but are not registered with MCTS/RCH. The States / UTs can
                            act upon this report and call up these numbers and after verifying that these numbers indeed
                            belong to the working ASHAs should advise ASHA to get their numbers registered in the
                            MCTS/RCH application. In this way, the application can assist States / UTs to register

                        <p>This report gives the line-listing of all beneficiaries whose registered mobile numbers are
                            either incorrect or are duplicate. These mobile numbers had flown in to the IVRS system but
                            were rejected by the acceptance logic run by the IVRS system. The report contains the MCTS
                            or RCH IDs. This report would be generated once every week preferably on Sunday. This line
                            listing report would be available for download for the respective district and block users.
                            These reports would be e-mailed to the respective block and district users on the day after
                            it was generated –on Tuesday. A summary mail giving the district wise break-up of the count
                            of beneficiaries would be sent to the State / UT users on the same day. The State / UT can
                            act upon this report and contact the ASHAs in the field and ask them to contact the said
                            beneficiaries and register their correct mobile numbers in the RCH Application. In this way
                            we can correct the mobile numbers of beneficiaries and bring a higher percentage of
                            beneficiaries under the ambit of Kilkari program. This report is a very useful actionable
                            report for the State / UT to correct the beneficiary contact mobile number. </p>

                            either incorrect or are duplicate. These mobile numbers had flown in to the IVRS system but
                            were rejected by the acceptance logic run by the IVRS system. The report contains the MCTS
                            or RCH IDs. This report would be generated once every week preferably on Sunday. This line
                            listing report would be available for download for the respective district and block users.
                            These reports would be e-mailed to the respective block and district users on the day after
                            it was generated –on Tuesday. A summary mail giving the district wise break-up of the count
                            of beneficiaries would be sent to the State / UT users on the same day. The State / UT can
                            act upon this report and contact the ASHAs in the field and ask them to contact the said
                            beneficiaries and register their correct mobile numbers in the RCH Application. In this way
                            we can correct the mobile numbers of beneficiaries and bring a higher percentage of
                            beneficiaries under the ambit of Kilkari program. This report is a very useful actionable
                            report for the State / UT to correct the beneficiary contact mobile number. </p>
