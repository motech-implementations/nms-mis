                    <p>These two metrics are not pregenerated. So they are based on live data while runtime, i.e., at the time when user is requesting for the report via MIS Portal.</p>
                    <p><b>Reason:</b>  For any report metric, the cumulative data upto any given date is available. For a selected date range, we pick the required metric as on these two dates and their difference will provide the required value. For example, number of first successful completion records.</p>
                    <p>But in case of pursuing and not pursuing, the calculation is based two dates. We can’t have a cumulative figure “count of pursuing as of a particular date”. So we cannot pregenerate this for every startDate - endDate combination.</p>

                    <p>These two metrics are not pregenerated. So they are based on live data while runtime, i.e., at the time when user is requesting for the report via MIS Portal.</p>
                    <p><b>Reason:</b>  For any report metric, the cumulative data upto any given date is available. For a selected date range, we pick the required metric as on these two dates and their difference will provide the required value. For example, number of first successful completion records.</p>
                    <p>But in case of pursuing and not pursuing, the calculation is based two dates. We can’t have a cumulative figure “count of pursuing as of a particular date”. So we cannot pregenerate this for every startDate - endDate combination.</p>

                    <p>These two metrics are not pregenerated. So they are based on live data while runtime, i.e., at the time when user is requesting for the report via MIS Portal.</p>
                    <p><b>Reason:</b>  For any report metric, the cumulative data upto any given date is available. For a selected date range, we pick the required metric as on these two dates and their difference will provide the required value. For example, number of first successful completion records.</p>
                    <p>But in case of pursuing and not pursuing, the calculation is based two dates. We can’t have a cumulative figure “count of pursuing as of a particular date”. So we cannot pregenerate this for every startDate - endDate combination.</p>

                    <p>These two metrics are not pregenerated. So they are based on live data while runtime, i.e., at the time when user is requesting for the report via MIS Portal.</p>
                    <p><b>Reason:</b>  For any report metric, the cumulative data upto any given date is available. For a selected date range, we pick the required metric as on these two dates and their difference will provide the required value. For example, number of first successful completion records.</p>
                    <p>But in case of pursuing and not pursuing, the calculation is based two dates. We can’t have a cumulative figure “count of pursuing as of a particular date”. So we cannot pregenerate this for every startDate - endDate combination.</p>
