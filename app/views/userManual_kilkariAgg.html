                        <p>This report gives month-wise distribution of all beneficiaries of a defined geographic zone,
                            in terms of the number of calls successfully answered during the specified month; i.e. this
                            report displays a count of beneficiaries who have listened to more than 5 calls, 5-calls,
                            4-calls, 3-calls, 2-calls, 1 call and 0 calls. This report gives a clear picture of the
                            percentage of regular listeners versus those who listen less regularly. This report gives
                            the details of the count month by month for the period of 6 months.</p>
                        <p>This report is generated by the fifth of every month for the previous month giving details of
                            the month by month calls for the last six months. The report has two tables – the first one
                            gives the count and the second giving the relative percentages. </p>

                            to whom calls were attempted by the Kilkari system during the month. The data in the Total
                            row should be summation of the data displayed in the four rows of the respective column. The
                            data in the Total column is summation of data displayed in the four columns in the
                            respective row.</p>

                            <li>The following is the equation used for calculating the percentage content listened to
                                for each beneficiary: % Content listened to = (Content listened to in all calls * 100) /
                                (Sum or total content duration of all answered calls) Content duration and not on call
                                duration is used as the basis of calculation in this report, as full content duration of
                                each message is fixed, while the total expected call duration cannot be fixed.
                            </li>
                            <li>The bracket of ‘listened to <25% content’ will include beneficiaries who have not
                                listened to any content, in case they answer the call.
                            </li>
                            <li>There is no ‘Total’ row for this report as a beneficiary could fall in two brackets in a
                                selected period. For example, a beneficiary could have listened to message 5-6 and
                                listened to 75% and then listened to message 7-8 and listened to 60% of content in the
                                same month. So, total count of all beneficiaries across all categories would consider
                                this beneficiary twice; thereby a ‘Total’ row for this report is meaningless.

                    <p>The following are the rules governing the report:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The following is the equation used for calculating the percentage content listened to
                            for each beneficiary: % Content listened to = (Content listened to in all calls * 100) /
                            (Sum or total content duration of all answered calls) Content duration and not on call
                            duration is used as the basis of calculation in this report, as full content duration of
                            each message is fixed, while the total expected call duration cannot be fixed.
                        </li>
                        <li>The bracket of ‘listened to <25% content’ will include beneficiaries who have not
                            listened to any content, in case they answer the call.
                        </li>
                        <li>There is no ‘Total’ row for this report as a beneficiary could fall in two brackets in a
                            selected period. For example, a beneficiary could have listened to message 5-6 and
                            listened to 75% and then listened to message 7-8 and listened to 60% of content in the
                            same month. So, total count of all beneficiaries across all categories would consider
                            this beneficiary twice; thereby a ‘Total’ row for this report is meaningless.

                        percent over the last 6 calls. This report gives information about the number of

                <p>This report gives month-wise distribution of all beneficiaries of a defined geographic zone,
                    in terms of the number of calls successfully answered during the specified month; i.e. this
                    report displays a count of beneficiaries who have listened to more than 5 calls, 5-calls,
                    4-calls, 3-calls, 2-calls, 1 call and 0 calls. This report gives a clear picture of the
                    percentage of regular listeners versus those who listen less regularly. This report gives
                    the details of the count month by month for the period of 6 months.</p>
                <p>This report is generated by the fifth of every month for the previous month giving details of
                    the month by month calls for the last six months. The report has two tables – the first one
                    gives the count and the second giving the relative percentages. </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>The following is the equation used for calculating the percentage content listened to
                        for each beneficiary: % Content listened to = (Content listened to in all calls * 100) /
                        (Sum or total content duration of all answered calls) Content duration and not on call
                        duration is used as the basis of calculation in this report, as full content duration of
                        each message is fixed, while the total expected call duration cannot be fixed.
                    </li>
                    <li>The bracket of ‘listened to <25% content’ will include beneficiaries who have not
                        listened to any content, in case they answer the call.
                    </li>
                    <li>There is no ‘Total’ row for this report as a beneficiary could fall in two brackets in a
                        selected period. For example, a beneficiary could have listened to message 5-6 and
                        listened to 75% and then listened to message 7-8 and listened to 60% of content in the
                        same month. So, total count of all beneficiaries across all categories would consider
                        this beneficiary twice; thereby a ‘Total’ row for this report is meaningless.

                <p>The rules governing the report is given below</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Total Number of unique beneficiaries (Column 3) is calculated as Total number of unique
                        beneficiaries called in the specified date range
                    </li>
                    <li>The following is the equation used for calculating the percentage calls for each

                        <ol>% Calls Answered = (Successful Calls * 100) / ( Success Calls + Failure Campaigns)
                            in the selected period. The following are the definitions of the values used in the
                            equation:
                        </ol>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Failure Campaigns: For each weekly campaign/message, the system reach out to the
                                beneficiary a maximum of up to 9 times i.e. if a beneficiary doesn’t answer a
                                call in the first attempt then a second, third and upto ninth attempt is made.
                                But, once answered it should be considered as only one message for the
                                calculation purpose in a week.
                            </li>
                            <li>Success calls: On occasions, a message can have more than one success call for a
                                beneficiary. This happens because of momentary network issues in IVR or Motech
                                backend. As all such attempts would be considered for billing purposes, all the
                                success calls are taken into consideration.

                        duration, as total expected call duration cannot be fixed. The following is the equation
                        used for calculating the percentage listened to for each beneficiary % Content listened
                        to = Actual content listened to in all answered calls * 100 divided by Sum of total

                        in the selected period and listened to average of more than or equal 75% content on all
                        the answered calls within the selected period.

                        calls within the selected period. This would take into consideration the calls which
                        were answered, but were disconnected / got dropped before message content started
                        playing.
                    </li>
                    <li>Column 9 reflects Total number of unique beneficiaries who have called the Kilkari Inbox

                <p>This report provides of the amount of content listened to by subscribers who have completed
                    Kilkari subscription over a selected period. It gives us the average number of weeks the
                    beneficiaries were active in service, the number of beneficiaries who have listened to
                    average content in categories of: more than 75% of content, between 50-75% of content,
                    25-50% of the content and less than the 25% of content. For the bucket ‘less than 25%’ of
                    the content listened to, only those subscribers who have at least ONE successful call
                    (answered call) are considered. The average for all these four buckets is calculated based
                    on the content duration of the successful calls only for the period of service the
                    subscriber remained active. </p>
                <p>This report supports selection of calendar year, financial year, quarter, month and week and

                        subscription because of live birth update, the number of weeks should be as follows:
                        (End date of child pack – Activation date of mother pack)/7. Similarly, the success
                        calls in both the packs will be taken into consideration for the percentage content

            <p>The following are the rules governing the report:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The following is the equation used for calculating the percentage content listened to
                    for each beneficiary: % Content listened to = (Content listened to in all calls * 100) /
                    (Sum or total content duration of all answered calls) Content duration and not on call
                    duration is used as the basis of calculation in this report, as full content duration of
                    each message is fixed, while the total expected call duration cannot be fixed.
                </li>
                <li>The bracket of ‘listened to <25% content’ will include beneficiaries who have not
                    listened to any content, in case they answer the call.
                </li>
                <li>There is no ‘Total’ row for this report as a beneficiary could fall in two brackets in a
                    selected period. For example, a beneficiary could have listened to message 5-6 and
                    listened to 75% and then listened to message 7-8 and listened to 60% of content in the
                    same month. So, total count of all beneficiaries across all categories would consider
                    this beneficiary twice; thereby a ‘Total’ row for this report is meaningless.

            <p>The rules governing the display components of the report is given below</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Total Number of unique beneficiaries (Column 3) is calculated as Total Number of Unique
                    beneficiaries for whom call was attempted to deliver the last message of the respective
                    Kilkari pack during the specified date range and will not be called again after the
                    completion of the specified period.
                </li>
                <li>Column 4 reflects the average age in terms of number of weeks the beneficiaries were
                    active in the service, for those beneficiaries that were called for the last time in the
                    specified date range. In case a beneficiary covers both mother pack and then child pack
                    subscription because of live birth update, the number of weeks should be as follows:
                    (End date of child pack – Activation date of mother pack)/7. Similarly, the success
                    calls in both the packs will be taken into consideration for the percentage content
                    listened to calculations for the columns below.
                </li>
                <li>Column 5 reflects total number of unique beneficiaries who have listened to more than
                    75% content on all the calls made to them including calls they have not answered during
                    their entire service period, only for those beneficiaries that were called for the last
                    time in the specified period.
                </li>
                <li>Column 6 reflects total number of unique beneficiaries who have listened to 50 % to 75%
                    content on all the calls made to them including calls they have not answered during
                    their entire service period, only for those beneficiaries that were called for the last
                    time in the specified period.
                </li>
                <li>Column 7 reflects total number of unique beneficiaries who have listened to 25 % to
                    49.9% content on all the calls made to them including calls they have not answered
                    during their entire service period, only for those beneficiaries that were called for
                    the last time in the specified period.
                </li>
                <li>Column 8 reflects the number of unique beneficiaries who have listened to less than 25%
                    content on all the calls made to them including calls they have not answered during
                    their entire service period, only for those beneficiaries that were called for the last
                    time in the specified period.
