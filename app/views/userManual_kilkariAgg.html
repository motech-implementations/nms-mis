This report will give a clear picture of the percentage of regular listeners versus those who listen less regularly. This report would give the details of the count for the period of 6 months.</p>
                    <p>This report would be generated on first of every month giving details of the calls for the last six months. The report will have two tables – the first one will give the count and the second giving the relative percentages. The report will have two displays – one as a tabular view and other as a Graphical view.</p>

                    </ol>
                    <p>The data should reflect the listening behavior of all users who were active in that period. The data in the Total row should be summation of the data displayed in the four rows of the respective column. The data in the Total column should be a summation of data displayed in the four columns in the respective row.</p>
                    <p>When-ever the user clicks on the “Bar Chart button”, the application must display graphical output of the respective report. A typical graphical output of the data of the first grid could be as shown below.</p>

                        <li>The following is the equation used for calculating the percentage listened to for each beneficiary:
                            % Content listened to = (Content listened to in all calls * 100) / (Sum or total content duration of answered calls)
                            The rule used to bracket beneficiaries should be based on content duration and not on call duration, as total expected call duration cannot be fixed.</li>
                        <li>The listening to <25% content bracket should include beneficiaries who have not listened to any content, in case they answer the call.</li>
                        <li>There will not be a ‘Total’ row for this report as a beneficiary could fall in two brackets in a selected period. For example, a beneficiary could have listened to message 5-6 and listened to 75% and then listened to message 7-8 and listened to 60% of content in a month. So, total count would consider this beneficiary twice.</li>

The report mentions for every message (denoted by Week) how many beneficiaries where called for that message, amongst them how many responded to the calls and how many minutes of calling were generated. This will give us an idea of the how many beneficiaries listened to a particular message which is based on a particular theme. This report can be generated for selected period. </p>

                    <p>This report gives at a glance the change in the beneficiaries subscribed in the Kilkari Project for a selected period. It gives information about the number of beneficiaries called in the period, the number of beneficiaries who have been deactivated from the system either by themselves or because of them not responding to calls for 6 consecutive weeks or because of listening to less than 25 percent of the calls. This report gives information about the number of beneficiaries who have completed their respective Mother and Child packs and how many beneficiaries who have joined in the selected period. This report gives a fair picture of whether the subscriber base of the program is increasing or decreasing.</p>
                    <p><b>NOTE:</b>If a mother and a child pack (representing the same beneficiary) are both added in the selected period, it should account for only ONE in the column ‘No. of beneficiaries who joined the subscription’.</p>

                    <p>This report gives the glance of the amount of content listened to by subscribers who have completed Kilkari project for a selected period. It gives us the average number of weeks the beneficiaries were in service, the number of beneficiaries who have listening more than 75% of content, between 50-75% of content, 25-50% of the content and less than the 25% of the content. For the bucket ‘less than 25%’ of the content listened, we are considering only those who have at least ONE successful call. The average for all these four buckets is calculated based on the content duration of the successful calls only for the period of service the beneficiary was active. </p>
                    <p>This report will support selection of calendar year, financial year, quarter, month and week and cannot support custom date range selection. This is because, beneficiaries who have answered at least one call and the related values, cannot be calculated real-time for every possible date combination and needs to be pre-calculated.</p>
                    <p>This report would give the details of the count for the selected period. This report will not have a graphical display.</p>

                    </ol>
                    <p>The rules governing the display components of the report is given below</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Total Number of unique beneficiaries (Column 3) is calculated as Total Number of Unique beneficiaries who have called for the last message of the respective pack during the specified date range and will not be called again after the completion of the specified date range.</li>
                        <li>Column 4 should reflect the average number of weeks for those beneficiaries that were called for the last time in the specified date range. In case a beneficiary covers both mother pack and then child pack subscription because of live birth update, the number of weeks should be as follows:
                            (End date of child pack – Activation date of mother pack)/7

                            The calculation should be particular for that pregnancy for the beneficiary and not for all the pregnancies over time.
                            Similarly, the success calls in both the packs should be taken into consideration for the percentage content listened to calculations for the columns below.
                        </li>
                        <li>Column 5 should reflect total number of unique beneficiaries who have listened to more than 75% content on all the calls made to them including calls they have not answered during their entire service period, only for those beneficiaries that are were called for the last time in the specified date range.</li>
                        <li>Column 6 should reflect total number of unique beneficiaries who have listened to 50 % to 75% content on all the calls made to them including calls they have not answered during their entire service period, only for those beneficiaries that are were called for the last time in the specified date range.</li>
                        <li>Column 7 should reflect total number of unique beneficiaries who have listened to 25 % to 49.9% content on all the calls made to them including calls they have not answered during their entire service period, only for those beneficiaries that are were called for the last time in the specified date range.</li>
                        <li>Column 8 should reflect the number of unique beneficiaries who have listened to less than 25% content on all the calls made to them including calls they have not answered during their entire service period, only for those beneficiaries that are were called for the last time in the specified date range.</li>
                        <li>The State data should have drill down feature. A user may click on a valid State / UT name and the report would display district wise data for the selected state. Similarly a user may click on a valid district name and the report would display block wise data for the selected district. Clicking on “Grand Total” will have no effect. Further there should be a BACK button below the report to enable the user go up the hierarchy and enable the report to display data in the form just prior to the current display based on user clicking on a valid state/district name.</li>
                        <li>All columns except Serial Number should have sort feature – a toggle switch through which the user can sort the data of the entire table on the selected column in alternatively ascending or descending order.</li>

                    <!--<p>In this report there could be one checkbox – “Include those deactivated after completing 75% of their respective packs”. When this checkbox is checked the value in column no 3 should include those beneficiaries who have deactivated themselves after completing the number of weeks that correspond to 75% of the duration of their respective packs and also those who have deactivated themselves in the last two weeks of their respective pack. The latter is included as they are most unlikely to re-register themselves again for listening to the remaining packs.</p>-->

                    <ol>
                        <li>The logic of the data displayed in the report is as follows
                            <ol>
                                <li>The report should display the data for 6 months from either the launch of Kilkari service in the region or December 2016.</li>
                                <li>Some beneficiaries could have listened to more than 5 calls in case of network fluctuations in either IVR or Motech servers, thus they should be bracketed separately.</li>
                                <li>The data of the first row and the first column in the first grid are the count of beneficiaries who have listened to total of more than 5 calls in a particular calendar month.</li>
                                <li>The data of the first row and the first column in the second grid are the percentage of beneficiaries who have listened to total more than of 5 calls in a particular calendar month among all the beneficiaries who have been called.</li>
                                <li>The data under the column 0 calls answered must be the number of beneficiaries who had been called any time during the month and did not respond to any of the calls made.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>The report should display data in the two grids – the first grid will display the actual numbers of beneficiaries.</li>
                        <li>The second grid will display data in percentages with the total summation for all columns for a particular month should be 100.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The data should reflect the listening behavior of all users who were active in that period. The data in the Total row should be summation of the data displayed in the four rows of the respective column.

                    <p>This report gives two–dimensional matrix report of count of beneficiaries who have listened to a particular range of messages and who have listened to a particular range of content duration. This report will give an understanding of the listening profile of subscribers as they mature within the system - do the listeners listen more or less as they hear more and more messages?</p>
                    <p>This report will support selection of calendar year, financial year, quarter, month and week and cannot support custom date range selection. This is because, beneficiaries who have answered at least one call and the related values, cannot be calculated real-time for every possible date combination and needs to be pre-calculated.</p>
                    <p>Drill-down from State to District to Block and Sub-center cannot be supported for this report as there is no corresponding column in the matrix/table.</p>
                    <p>This report will display a matrix that will display the listening profiles of the beneficiaries.

                        <li>The logic of the data displayed in the report is as follows

                                <li>The data in the grid of the first row and the first column are the count of beneficiaries who have listened to average of > 75% content across Message no 1 to 6. If a beneficiary has not listened to a particular message then it is deemed to have listened to 0% of the content for that message and average is calculated based on that.</li>
                            </ol>

                    <ol>
                        <li>The following is the equation used for calculating the percentage listened to for each beneficiary:
                            % Content listened to = (Content listened to in all calls * 100) / (Sum or total content duration of answered calls)
                            The rule used to bracket beneficiaries should be based on content duration and not on call duration, as total expected call duration cannot be fixed.</li>
                        <li>The listening to <25% content bracket should include beneficiaries who have not listened to any content, in case they answer the call.</li>
                        <li>There will not be a ‘Total’ row for this report as a beneficiary could fall in two brackets in a selected period. For example, a beneficiary could have listened to message 5-6 and listened to 75% and then listened to message 7-8 and listened to 60% of content in a month. So, total count would consider this beneficiary twice.</li>

                    <p>This report gives two – dimensional matrix report of count of beneficiaries who have listened to a particular range of calls and who have listened to a particular range of content duration. This report will give a clear picture of the listening profile of subscribers. Are the regular listeners also the long duration listeners? This matrix report would give the details of the count for the selected period. This report will not have a graphical display.</p>
                    <p>This report will support selection of calendar year, financial year, quarter, month and week and cannot support custom date range selection. This is because, beneficiaries who have answered at least one call and the related values, cannot be calculated real-time for every possible date combination and needs to be pre-calculated.</p>
                    <p>Drill-down from State to District to Block and Sub-center cannot be supported for this report as there is no corresponding column in the matrix/table.</p>
                    <p>This report will display a matrix that will display the listening profiles of the beneficiaries.

                    <p>This report gives at a glance the change in the beneficiaries subscribed in the Kilkari Project for a selected period. It gives information about the number of beneficiaries called in the period, the number of beneficiaries who have been deactivated from the system either by themselves or because of them not responding to calls for 6 consecutive weeks or because of listening to less than 25 percent of the calls. This report gives information about the number of beneficiaries who have completed their respective Mother and Child packs and how many beneficiaries who have joined in the selected period. This report gives a fair picture of whether the subscriber base of the program is increasing or decreasing.</p>
                    <p><b>NOTE:</b>If a mother and a child pack (representing the same beneficiary) are both added in the selected period, it should account for only ONE in the column ‘No. of beneficiaries who joined the subscription’.</p>
                    <p>This report will support selection of calendar year, financial year, quarter, month and week and cannot support custom date range selection. This is because, beneficiaries who have answered at least one call cannot be calculated real-time for every possible date combination and needs to be pre-calculated.</p>

                    <p>This report gives the glance of the amount of content listened to by subscribers who have completed Kilkari project for a selected period. It gives us the average number of weeks the beneficiaries were in service, the number of beneficiaries who have listening more than 75% of content, between 50-75% of content, 25-50% of the content and less than the 25% of the content. For the bucket ‘less than 25%’ of the content listened, we are considering only those who have at least ONE successful call. The average for all these four buckets is calculated based on the content duration of the successful calls only for the period of service the beneficiary was active. </p>
                    <p>This report will support selection of calendar year, financial year, quarter, month and week and cannot support custom date range selection. This is because, beneficiaries who have answered at least one call and the related values, cannot be calculated real-time for every possible date combination and needs to be pre-calculated.</p>
                    <p>This report would give the details of the count for the selected period. This report will not have a graphical display.</p>
                    <p>The report displays the data in the following sequence of columns when logged in:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Serial Number</li>
                        <li>State</li>
                        <li>Total beneficiaries Completed Program</li>
                        <li>Average Number of Weeks in Service</li>
                        <li>Beneficiaries who have listened more than 75% content (consolidated)</li>
                        <li>Beneficiaries who have listened 50 to 75% content (consolidated)</li>
                        <li>Beneficiaries who have listened 25 to 49.9% content (consolidated)</li>
                        <li>Beneficiaries who have listened less than 25% content (consolidated)</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The rules governing the display components of the report is given below</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Total Number of unique beneficiaries (Column 3) is calculated as Total Number of Unique beneficiaries who have called for the last message of the respective pack during the specified date range and will not be called again after the completion of the specified date range.</li>
                        <li>Column 4 should reflect the average number of weeks for those beneficiaries that were called for the last time in the specified date range. In case a beneficiary covers both mother pack and then child pack subscription because of live birth update, the number of weeks should be as follows:
                            (End date of child pack – Activation date of mother pack)/7

                            The calculation should be particular for that pregnancy for the beneficiary and not for all the pregnancies over time.
                            Similarly, the success calls in both the packs should be taken into consideration for the percentage content listened to calculations for the columns below.
                        </li>
                        <li>Column 5 should reflect total number of unique beneficiaries who have listened to more than 75% content on all the calls made to them including calls they have not answered during their entire service period, only for those beneficiaries that are were called for the last time in the specified date range.</li>
                        <li>Column 6 should reflect total number of unique beneficiaries who have listened to 50 % to 75% content on all the calls made to them including calls they have not answered during their entire service period, only for those beneficiaries that are were called for the last time in the specified date range.</li>
                        <li>Column 7 should reflect total number of unique beneficiaries who have listened to 25 % to 49.9% content on all the calls made to them including calls they have not answered during their entire service period, only for those beneficiaries that are were called for the last time in the specified date range.</li>
                        <li>Column 8 should reflect the number of unique beneficiaries who have listened to less than 25% content on all the calls made to them including calls they have not answered during their entire service period, only for those beneficiaries that are were called for the last time in the specified date range.</li>
                        <li>The State data should have drill down feature. A user may click on a valid State / UT name and the report would display district wise data for the selected state. Similarly a user may click on a valid district name and the report would display block wise data for the selected district. Clicking on “Grand Total” will have no effect. Further there should be a BACK button below the report to enable the user go up the hierarchy and enable the report to display data in the form just prior to the current display based on user clicking on a valid state/district name.</li>
                        <li>All columns except Serial Number should have sort feature – a toggle switch through which the user can sort the data of the entire table on the selected column in alternatively ascending or descending order.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <!--<p>In this report there could be one checkbox – “Include those deactivated after completing 75% of their respective packs”. When this checkbox is checked the value in column no 3 should include those beneficiaries who have deactivated themselves after completing the number of weeks that correspond to 75% of the duration of their respective packs and also those who have deactivated themselves in the last two weeks of their respective pack. The latter is included as they are most unlikely to re-register themselves again for listening to the remaining packs.</p>-->

                    <p>The following are the rules governing the report:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The following is the equation used for calculating the percentage listened to for each beneficiary:
                            % Content listened to = (Content listened to in all calls * 100) / (Sum or total content duration of answered calls)
                            The rule used to bracket beneficiaries should be based on content duration and not on call duration, as total expected call duration cannot be fixed.</li>
                        <li>The listening to <25% content bracket should include beneficiaries who have not listened to any content, in case they answer the call.</li>
                        <li>There will not be a ‘Total’ row for this report as a beneficiary could fall in two brackets in a selected period. For example, a beneficiary could have listened to message 5-6 and listened to 75% and then listened to message 7-8 and listened to 60% of content in a month. So, total count would consider this beneficiary twice.</li>

                    <p>This report gives the glance the listening pattern of the subscriber in the Kilkari project for a selected period. It gives us the number of beneficiaries called during the period, the number of beneficiaries who are listening more than 75% of content, between 50-75% of content, 25-50% of the content and less than the 25% of the content. The average is calculated based on the call duration of the successful calls only. </p>
                    <p>This report will support selection of calendar year, financial year, quarter, month and week and cannot support custom date range selection. This is because, beneficiaries who have answered at least one call and the related values, cannot be calculated real-time for every possible date combination and needs to be pre-calculated.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>The rule used to bracket beneficiaries should be based on content duration and not on call duration, as total expected call duration cannot be fixed. The following is the equation used for calculating the percentage listened to for each beneficiary
                            % Content listened to = Content listened to in all calls * 100
                            -----------------------------------------

                        <li>Total Number of unique beneficiaries (Column 3) is calculated as Total Number of Unique beneficiaries called in the specified date range</li>
                        <li>Column 4 should reflect the number of unique beneficiaries that have answered one call in the specified date range.</li>
                        <li>Column 5 should reflect the number of unique beneficiaries who have answered at least one call in the specified date range and listened to average of more than or equal 75% content on all the answered calls within the specified date range.</li>
                        <li>Column 6 should reflect total number of unique beneficiaries who have answered at least one call in the specified date range and listened to average of 50 % to < 75% content on all the answered calls within the specified date range.</li>
                        <li>Column 7 should reflect Total number of unique beneficiaries who have answered at least one call in the specified date range and listened to average of 25 % to <50% content on all the answered calls within the specified date range.</li>
                        <li>Column 8 should reflect Total unique beneficiaries who have answered at least one call in the specified date range and listened to average of less than 25% content on all the answered calls within the specified date range. This would take into consideration the calls which were answered, but was dropped before message content started playing.</li>
                        <li>Column 9 should reflect Total number of unique beneficiaries who have called the Kilkari Inbox in the specified date range and listened to the message content.</li>
                        <li>The State data should have drill down feature. A user may click on a valid State / UT name and the report would display district wise data for the selected state. Similarly a user may click on a valid district name and the report would display block wise data for the selected district. Clicking on “Grand Total” will have no effect. Further there should be a BACK button below the report to enable the user go up the hierarchy and enable the report to display data in the form just prior to the current display based on user clicking on a valid state/district name.</li>
                        <li>All columns except Serial Number should have sort feature – a toggle switch through which the user can sort the data of the entire table on the selected column in alternatively ascending or descending order.</li>

                    <p>This report gives the glance of the amount of content listened to by subscribers who have completed Kilkari project for a selected period. It gives us the average number of weeks the beneficiaries were in service, the number of beneficiaries who have listening more than 75% of content, between 50-75% of content, 25-50% of the content and less than the 25% of the content. For the bucket ‘less than 25%’ of the content listened, we are considering only those who have at least ONE successful call. The average for all these four buckets is calculated based on the content duration of the successful calls only for the period of service the beneficiary was active. </p>
                    <p>This report will support selection of calendar year, financial year, quarter, month and week and cannot support custom date range selection. This is because, beneficiaries who have answered at least one call and the related values, cannot be calculated real-time for every possible date combination and needs to be pre-calculated.</p>
                    <p>This report would give the details of the count for the selected period. This report will not have a graphical display.</p>
                    <p>The report displays the data in the following sequence of columns when logged in:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Serial Number</li>
                        <li>State</li>
                        <li>Total beneficiaries Completed Program</li>
                        <li>Average Number of Weeks in Service</li>
                        <li>Beneficiaries who have listened more than 75% content (consolidated)</li>
                        <li>Beneficiaries who have listened 50 to 75% content (consolidated)</li>
                        <li>Beneficiaries who have listened 25 to 49.9% content (consolidated)</li>
                        <li>Beneficiaries who have listened less than 25% content (consolidated)</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The rules governing the display components of the report is given below</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Total Number of unique beneficiaries (Column 3) is calculated as Total Number of Unique beneficiaries who have called for the last message of the respective pack during the specified date range and will not be called again after the completion of the specified date range.</li>
                        <li>Column 4 should reflect the average number of weeks for those beneficiaries that were called for the last time in the specified date range. In case a beneficiary covers both mother pack and then child pack subscription because of live birth update, the number of weeks should be as follows:
                            (End date of child pack – Activation date of mother pack)/7

                            The calculation should be particular for that pregnancy for the beneficiary and not for all the pregnancies over time.
                            Similarly, the success calls in both the packs should be taken into consideration for the percentage content listened to calculations for the columns below.
                        </li>
                        <li>Column 5 should reflect total number of unique beneficiaries who have listened to more than 75% content on all the calls made to them including calls they have not answered during their entire service period, only for those beneficiaries that are were called for the last time in the specified date range.</li>
                        <li>Column 6 should reflect total number of unique beneficiaries who have listened to 50 % to 75% content on all the calls made to them including calls they have not answered during their entire service period, only for those beneficiaries that are were called for the last time in the specified date range.</li>
                        <li>Column 7 should reflect total number of unique beneficiaries who have listened to 25 % to 49.9% content on all the calls made to them including calls they have not answered during their entire service period, only for those beneficiaries that are were called for the last time in the specified date range.</li>
                        <li>Column 8 should reflect the number of unique beneficiaries who have listened to less than 25% content on all the calls made to them including calls they have not answered during their entire service period, only for those beneficiaries that are were called for the last time in the specified date range.</li>
                        <li>The State data should have drill down feature. A user may click on a valid State / UT name and the report would display district wise data for the selected state. Similarly a user may click on a valid district name and the report would display block wise data for the selected district. Clicking on “Grand Total” will have no effect. Further there should be a BACK button below the report to enable the user go up the hierarchy and enable the report to display data in the form just prior to the current display based on user clicking on a valid state/district name.</li>
                        <li>All columns except Serial Number should have sort feature – a toggle switch through which the user can sort the data of the entire table on the selected column in alternatively ascending or descending order.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <!--<p>In this report there could be one checkbox – “Include those deactivated after completing 75% of their respective packs”. When this checkbox is checked the value in column no 3 should include those beneficiaries who have deactivated themselves after completing the number of weeks that correspond to 75% of the duration of their respective packs and also those who have deactivated themselves in the last two weeks of their respective pack. The latter is included as they are most unlikely to re-register themselves again for listening to the remaining packs.</p>-->

                            The rule used to bracket beneficiaries should be based on content duration and not on call duration, as total expected call duration cannot be fixed.</li>

                                <li>Success calls: On occasions, a message can have more than one success call for a beneficiary. This happens because of momentary network issues in IVR or Motech backend. As all such attempts would be considered for billing purposes, all the success calls are taken into consideration.</li>

                        <li>The rule used to bracket beneficiaries should be based on content duration and not on call duration, as total expected call duration cannot be fixed. The following is the equation used for calculating the percentage listened to for each beneficiary
                            % Content listened to = Content listened to in all calls * 100
                            -----------------------------------------

                        <li>Column 5 should reflect the number of unique beneficiaries who have answered at least one call in the specified date range and listened to average of more than or equal 75% content on all the answered calls within the specified date range.</li>
                        <li>Column 6 should reflect total number of unique beneficiaries who have answered at least one call in the specified date range and listened to average of 50 % to < 75% content on all the answered calls within the specified date range.</li>
                        <li>Column 7 should reflect Total number of unique beneficiaries who have answered at least one call in the specified date range and listened to average of 25 % to <50% content on all the answered calls within the specified date range.</li>
                        <li>Column 8 should reflect Total unique beneficiaries who have answered at least one call in the specified date range and listened to average of less than 25% content on all the answered calls within the specified date range. This would take into consideration the calls which were answered, but was dropped before message content started playing.</li>
                        <li>Column 9 should reflect Total number of unique beneficiaries who have called the Kilkari Inbox in the specified date range and listened to the message content.</li>

                    <!--<p>In this report there could be one checkbox – “Include those deactivated after completing 75% of their respective packs”. When this checkbox is checked the value in column no 3 should include those beneficiaries who have deactivated themselves after completing the number of weeks that correspond to 75% of the duration of their respective packs and also those who have deactivated themselves in the last two weeks of their respective pack. The latter is included as they are most unlikely to re-register themselves again for listening to the remaining packs.</p>-->
